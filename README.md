# Phase 1: Object Ball

## Overview
This project is a JavaScript simulation of a basketball game which is using objects to represent teams, players, and their statistics.

## Features
- represents two NBA teams with detailed player stats.
- created functions to retrieve player stats, team colors, and player details.
- functions to determine the highest-scoring players and the winning team.
- functions for finding the player with the largest shoe size and the player with the longest name.

## Technologies Used
- JavaScript
- Node.js 

## Usage
- Open `script.js` to examine the object structure and functions.
- Run functions in a JavaScript environment (VSC/browser console) to retrieve team and player statistics.
- Modify the object structure or add new functions to extend functionality.

## Example Functions
### Retrieve a Player's Points
```js
console.log(numPointsScored("Ben Gordon")); // Output: 33
```

### Retrieve Team Colors
```js
console.log(teamColors("Brooklyn Nets")); // Output: ["black", "white"]
```

### Find the Player with the Most Points
```js
console.log(mostPointsScored()); // Output: "Ben Gordon"
```

console.log(winningTeam()); // Output: "The NBA Finals Champions for 2025 are the Brooklyn Nets!"
```
